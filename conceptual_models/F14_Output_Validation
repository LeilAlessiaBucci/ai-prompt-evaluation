# F14 - Output Validation (Logical & Terminological Consistency)

## Overview

**F14 is a conceptual framework for validating model outputs through structured checks on logic, terminology, and internal coherence.**

It is designed to improve reliability, reduce ambiguity, and support rigorous evaluation of generated content.

F14 is not an executable system, but a formal validation layer that defines *what must hold true* for an output to be considered acceptable.

---

## Purpose

**Ensure that generated outputs remain logically coherent, terminologically consistent, and epistemically defensible.**

The framework aims to detect and prevent:
- internal contradictions  
- semantic drift  
- unjustified claims  
- hidden assumptions  
- incoherent reasoning chains  

---

## Scope

F14 applies to any output intended to inform, explain, or support decision-making.

Typical use cases include:
- prompt evaluation  
- model response auditing  
- knowledge validation layers  
- safety and quality control pipelines  

---

## Core Validation Dimensions

### 1. Logical Coherence

Verify that all statements are mutually consistent and that conclusions follow from premises.

No internal contradictions, hidden leaps, or circular reasoning are allowed.

---

### 2. Terminological Consistency

Ensure stable meaning across the entire output.

Key terms must:
- retain the same definition throughout  
- avoid semantic drift  
- be normalized when synonyms or variants appear  

---

### 3. Ambiguity Control

Detect expressions that allow multiple materially different interpretations.

When ambiguity arises:
- prefer clarification over assumption  
- constrain interpretation rather than speculate  

---

### 4. Verifiability Gate

Identify claims that require external validation.

If verification is not available:
- mark the claim as uncertain, or  
- suspend it rather than fabricating support  

---

## Failure Handling

When a violation is detected, F14 does not attempt to compensate or invent corrections.

Instead, it triggers one of the following:
- targeted revision  
- explicit qualification of uncertainty  
- suspension of the affected statement  

This preserves epistemic integrity over output completeness.

---

## Rationale

Many failures in AI-generated content are not factual errors but structural ones:
- inconsistent terminology  
- unstable assumptions  
- silent shifts in meaning  

F14 formalizes a defensive layer against these failure modes.

---

## Intended Use

F14 can be implemented as:
- a checklist for human review  
- a rule set for automated validators  
- a meta-layer in prompt engineering  
- a quality gate in evaluation pipelines  

It is agnostic to model architecture and can be adapted to multiple contexts.

---

## Summary

F14 defines a minimal, strict framework for output validation focused on:

- logical consistency  
- semantic clarity  
- controlled ambiguity  
- traceable reasoning  

Its purpose is not to enrich content, but to make it *reliable*.
