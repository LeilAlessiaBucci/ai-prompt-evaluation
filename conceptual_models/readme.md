# Functional Specification Set (F-Series)

This repository contains a structured collection of formal specifications—referred to as **F-units**—that define the internal logic, constraints, and behavioral rules of a complex conceptual system.

Each F-unit describes a specific functional domain (e.g. reasoning, validation, memory, control, coherence) using a compact, declarative format designed to be **interpretable, composable, and implementation-agnostic**.

These specifications are not executable code.  
They are *conceptual modules* intended to describe how a system should behave, not how it is implemented.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a **clear, modular, and formally constrained description** of a system’s internal logic, suitable for:

- conceptual modeling  
- reasoning system design  
- cognitive or epistemic architectures  
- AI evaluation and governance frameworks  
- research and documentation contexts  

Each file represents a **functional unit** that can be studied, extended, or mapped onto concrete implementations.

---

## Structure of the Framework

Each F-unit defines a specific role within the overall system, such as:

- information intake and filtering  
- validation and coherence enforcement  
- memory and continuity management  
- decision constraints and prioritization  
- safety, consistency, and self-regulation mechanisms  

Together, these units form a **modular architecture**, where each component is logically independent but interoperable with the others.

---

## Design Principles

The framework is built around a small set of guiding principles:

- **Explicitness** – all assumptions and constraints are stated explicitly  
- **Determinism** – definitions are stable and non-ambiguous  
- **Non-procedural structure** – describes *what must hold*, not *how to execute*  
- **Composability** – each unit can be understood independently or as part of a whole  
- **Auditability** – reasoning paths can be inspected and traced  

---

## Intended Use

This repository is suitable for:

- documenting complex reasoning systems  
- supporting design of AI evaluation or governance frameworks  
- serving as a reference for structured reasoning patterns  
- enabling conceptual analysis of autonomous or semi-autonomous systems  

It is **not** a software library, SDK, or runnable framework.

---

## Scope and Limitations

- The contents are **descriptive**, not executable.
- No assumptions are made about specific programming languages or platforms.
- Interpretation and implementation are left to the user or system designer.
- The framework is intentionally abstract to preserve adaptability.
