# AI-Prompt-Evaluation
Qualitative analysis and evaluation of large language model outputs, focusing on coherence, reliability, and responsible AI use.

This repository houses a collection of formal conceptual specifications (“F-units”) used to document and reason about structured reasoning systems. Each unit defines a distinct functional role in a broader architecture.

The focus of this work is on assessing:
- coherence and internal consistency of generated content  
- alignment with user intent and contextual constraints  
- clarity, structure, and semantic accuracy  
- potential bias, ambiguity, or misleading patterns  

The goal is to support responsible and reliable use of generative AI systems through structured qualitative analysis.
